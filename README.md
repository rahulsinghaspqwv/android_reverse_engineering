# android_reverse_engineering
Journey of reverse engineering, trying to use Authentic way with bunch of tools. i'll list all tools and way with my research papers and also share all knowledge which will i get in this journey. 

# Slogan 
if you want to know about anything. The best way is break it and then agian build it. 

# Steps to approach for reverse engineering 
First we need to download multiple version of java
Second we need to download multiple version of python using pyenv
Third you need to build virtual machines and virtual android devices 

# Devices Physical or Virtual
First you should have atleaset decent performence laptop or pc 
CPU - any intel based or AMD based with minimum 8 cores with 12 threads 
GPU - any with more gpu cude number with more vram support minimum 6 GB 
RAM - 32 GB atleast DDR4 if it's DDR5 then much better (at least 24GB required for runing host os and one to two virtual machines at the smae time.)
SSD - 1TB (atleast 512GB required) 
Wireless Card - Go for Dual band wireless card and make sure it supports 2.4Ghz and also 5Ghz both channel and it's also have packet injection support. 

purchase spare android phones or collect from where you can .
you need to 2 to 3 physical spare android phones which have at least android 8 

# Making the Lab Setup
install any linux with Debian based x64 on virtual machine. 
make android mobile virtual machine also - use andorid studio avd or Genymotion avds
install Mobexler on a virtual machine. 
update your linux packages 
install android platform tools - adb and fastboot 
install burpsuite professional 
install wireshark
